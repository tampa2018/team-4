CODE FOR GOOD
Organization: Radical Partners

This is a web application that allows users to use either Facebook authentication or email to create an account.
The user should have a connection to the Southern part of Florida. This user is allowed to voice their opinion
in this campaign website. The essential goal is to allow Southern Floridians to post what they believe in. They
can also suggest ideas as for campaigns. The organization will communicate with the politicians to advocate for
them.
